 <font size="5">
     In computer engineering, computer architecture is a science or a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. and stating how computer software and hardware are joined together and interact to make a computer work. It not only determines how the computer works but also of which technologies the computer is capable. Computers continue to be a major part of our lives, and computer architects continue to develop new and better programs and technologies.

     <strong> <font color="light blue" size="6"> History: </font> </strong>
     <br>
     The first documented computer architecture was in the correspondence between Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, describing the analytical engine. When building the computer Z1 in 1936, Konrad Zuse described in two patent applications for his future projects that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data, i.e., the stored-program concept.
     The term “architecture” in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., members of the Machine Organization department in IBM's main research center in 1959. Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research communication about the Stretch, an IBM-developed supercomputer for Los Alamos National Laboratory (at the time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory). To describe the level of detail for discussing the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his description of formats, instruction types, hardware parameters, and speed enhancements were at the level of “system architecture”, a term that seemed more useful than “machine organization”.

     Subsequently, Brooks, a Stretch designer, opened Chapter 2 of a book called Planning a Computer System: Project Stretch by stating, “Computer architecture, like other architecture, is the art of determining the needs of the user of a structure and then designing to meet those needs as effectively as possible within economic and technological constraints.”

     Brooks went on to help develop the IBM System/360 (now called the IBM zSeries) line of computers, in which “architecture” became a noun defining “what the user needs to know”. Later, computer users came to use the term in many less explicit ways.

     The earliest computer architectures were designed on paper and then directly built into the final hardware form. Later, computer architecture prototypes were physically built in the form of a transistor–transistor logic (TTL) computer—such as the prototypes of the 6800 and the PA-RISC—tested, and tweaked, before committing to the final hardware form. As of the 1990s, new computer architectures are typically "built", tested, and tweaked—inside some other computer architecture in a computer architecture simulator; or inside a FPGA as a soft microprocessor; or both—before committing to the final hardware form.

     <strong> <font color="light blue" size="6"> Computer Organization: </font></strong>
     <br>
     Computer organization helps optimize performance-based products. For example, software engineers need to know the processing power of processors. They may need to optimize software in order to gain the most performance for the lowest price. This can require quite a detailed analysis of the computer's organization. For example, in an SD card, the designers might need to arrange the card so that the most data can be processed in the fastest possible way.

     Computer organization also helps plan the selection of a processor for a particular project. Multimedia projects may need very rapid data access, while virtual machines may need fast interrupts. Sometimes certain tasks need additional components as well. For example, a computer capable of running a virtual machine needs virtual memory hardware so that the memory of different virtual computers can be kept separated. Computer organization and features also affect power consumption and processor cost.

     <strong> <font color="light blue" size="6"> Types of computer Architecture: </font></strong>
     <br>
     <font color="orange">1. Von-Neumann Architecture: </font>
     This architecture is proposed by john von-neumann. Now a day's computer we are using are based on von-neumann architecture. It is based on some concepts. The memory we have a single read/write memory available for read and write instructions and data.
     When we talk about memory, it is nothing but the single location whic Each memory has multiple locations and each location has a unique address. We can address the contents of memory by its location irrespective of what type of data and
     There is a bus (address bus/data bus/control bus) used for the instruction and data code execution. Input device takes data or instruction and the Central processing.
     <br>
     <font color="orange">2. Harvard Architecture: </font>
     Harvard architecture is used when data and code is present in different memory blocks. A separate memory block is needed for data and instruction. Data can be accessed
     Modified harvard architecture is like a harvard architecture machine and it has a common address space for the separate data and instruction cache. It has digital sign
     We can observe in the below image, there are separate data and instruction memory that is a bus available to perform operations. 
     <br>
     <font color="orange">3. Instruction Set Architecture: </font>
     <br>
     To make up the architecture, instruction set architecture is needed because it has a set of instructions that the processor understands. It has the instruction set one! Reduced instruction set computer architecture was realized in the 90's by TBM.
     Instruction has multiple address modes, but programs do not use all of the that is theprocessor understands. It has two instruction set one
     Reduced instruction set computer architecture was realized in the 90's by IBM. Instruction has multiple address modes, but programs do not use all of them that is the Complex instruction set architecture is the root of compilers because earlier compilers were not there to write programs, to ease programming instructions are added.
     <br>
     <font color="orange">4. Microarchitecture:</font>
     <br>
     Microarchitecture is known as computer organizations and it is the way when instruction set architecture is a built-in processor. Instruction set architecture is imple Microarchitecture performs in a certain way. It reads the instruction and decodes it, will find parallel data to process the instruction and then will process the inst It is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers.
     Some architectures overlap multiple instructions while executing but this does not happen in microarchitecture.
     <br>
     <font color="orange">5. System Design:</font>
     <br>
     The name defines itself, the design will satisfy user requirements such as architecture, module, Interfaces and data for a system and it is connected to product developer continusly.
