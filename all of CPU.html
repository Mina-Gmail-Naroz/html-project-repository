            Central Processing Unit (CPU):is called processor..it is``brain'' that does arithmetic, responds to incoming information,related operations on numbers ,generates outgoing information and can hold in its data registers
            A processor's speed is measured in Hertz (a kind of vibration speed) and is literally the speed of the computer's internal clock; the larger the Hertz number, the faster the processor.

            <font color="light blue" size="6"> Mashine cycle </font>
            <br>
            A machine cycle consists of the steps that a computer’s processor executes whenever it receives a machine language instruction. It is the most basic CPU operation, and modern CPUs are able to perform millions of machine cycles per second. The cycle consists of three standard steps: fetch, decode and execute. In some cases, store is also incorporated into the cycle.

            <font color="light blue" size="6"> CPU Design Goals </font>
            <br>
            CPUs designed for high-performance markets might require custom (optimized or application specific (see below)) designs for each of these items to achieve frequency, power-dissipation, and chip-area goals whereas CPUs designed for lower performance markets might lessen the implementation burden by acquiring some of these items by purchasing them as intellectual property. Control logic implementation techniques (logic synthesis using CAD tools) can be used to implement datapaths, register files, and clocks. Common logic styles used in CPU design include unstructured random logic, finite-state machines, microprogramming (common from 1965 to 1985), and Programmable logic arrays (common in the 1980s, no longer common).

            <strong>INSTRUCTION SETS</strong>
            <br>
            CPU design is heavily influenced by the type of instruction sets being used. In general, there are two approaches to instructions. The first is random logic. Sometimes
            The second approach to instruction sets is microcode. Microcode is sometimes called "emulation because it references an operations table and uses sets of microinstruc The most influential factor to consider when weighing random logic against microcode is memory speed. Random logic usually produces a speedier CPU when CPU speeds outputs.

            <strong>REDUCED INSTRUCTION SET COMPUTER (RISC)</strong>
            <br>
            is a computer with a small, highly optimized set of instructions, rather than the more specialized set often found in other types of architecture, such as in a complex instruction set computer (CISC). The main distinguishing feature of RISC architecture is that the instruction set is optimized with a large number of registers and a highly regular instruction pipeline, allowing a low number of clock cycles per instruction (CPI). Core features of a RISC philosophy are a load/store architecture, in which memory is accessed through specific instructions rather than as a part of most instructions in the set, and requiring only single-cycle instructions.

            <strong>MOORE'S LAW</strong>
            <br>
            Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.
